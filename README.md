# Type 2 Diabetes Analysis

### Overview

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of eight medical variables of patients explored their relationship with the outcome of the diagnosis - whether or not they had diabetes.  I also train predictive models using logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to predict the diagnosis based on given variables.  Then, I assess the recall and precision.  The models are improved to maximize recall.
