# Type 2 Diabetes Analysis

### Overview

This project offers an in-depth analysis of eight medical variables and their relationship with the outcome of the type 2 diabetes diagnosis.  The eight observed variables are number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.  These variables are analyzed using data science methods to assess their significance in predicting a positive type 2 diabetes diagnosis.  In this project, I also train several predictive models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to predict the diagnosis based on a given set of variables.  Afterwards, the models are adjusted to maximize recall, thus lowering the rate of false negatives.

Tools used: Sci-Kit Learn, matplotlib, seaborne, statsmodels
